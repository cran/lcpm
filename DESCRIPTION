Title: Ordinal Outcomes: Generalized Linear Models with the Log Link
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Gurbakhshash Singh and Gordon Hilton Fick
Maintainer: Gurbakhshash Singh <gsingh@ccsu.edu>
Description: An implementation of the Log Cumulative Probability Model (LCPM) 
  and Proportional Probability Model (PPM) for which the Maximum Likelihood Estimates are determined using constrained optimization. 
  This implementation accounts for the implicit constraints on the parameter space. Other 
  features such as standard errors, z tests and p-values use standard methods adapted from the results based on constrained optimization.
